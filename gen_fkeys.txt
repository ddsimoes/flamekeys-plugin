==============================================================================



1 - DESCRIPTION:

       Flamekeys plugin is a add-on that activates hotkeys for several
    functions on Winamp.
       It's a full-configurable plug-in. You can change the hotkeys and
    disable/enable all the implemented functions.
       Also you can enable the plug-in OSD that provides feedback to commands
    that don't open a window (Play, Pause, Next, Volume, etc).
       It also have a "playback resume" feature which saves the song
    position and when you restart Winamp the song are resumed.


2 - HOW TO USE:

       Install the plug-in and just press the keys to acess the functions you
    want.

       The default hotkeys are:

       <CTRL>+<SHIFT>+

          [1]       Previous
          [2]       Play/Stop
          [3]       Pause
          [4]       Next
          [5]       Open file(s)

     NOTE:
       The number keys here are those that are close to the letters, not
    the numpad keys. Is "1", not "NUM 1".


3 - HOW TO CONFIGURE:

   3.1 - Opening configuration:

     Open "Winamp preferences";
     "Plugin/General Purpose";
     Choose "Flamekeys plugin v2.0 [gen_fkeys.dll]";
     Click "Configure".


   3.2 - Valid hotkeys rules:

      1 - You must combine modifiers (Control, Alt, Shift, Winkey) with any
          another key;
      2 - Shift modifier can only be used with other modifier;
      3 - Function keys (F1, F2, etc.) can be used without modifiers or with
          Shift only;
      4 - Enter, Tab, Esc, Caps Lock, Num Lock, Print Screen, Pause/Break
          cannot be used;


   3.3 - Recommended hotkeys:

      * Avoid to use only one modifier, unless it's the Winkey. This can cause conflict
        with Windows and other applications.
      * Try to not use function keys without modifiers.

      These features are PERMITED but not RECOMMENDED.

      Example:
        If you choose Alt+F4, it's permited. But when you want to close you
        window with this keys, the window will not close.


   3.4 - Options:

      * Show warning on hotkey register error

          If the plug-in tries to register a key that are reserved or prior
          registered by another application the plug-in can ignore it and
          register the other keys or can show a warning window telling you
          about the problem.


      * Enable OSD

          Show OSD window when you use no windowed functions.



   3.5 - OSD:


      * Display time (1/10s)

          How long the OSD window will remain on the screen.


      * Fadeout effect (Win2k/XP)

          OSD "disapears" slowly instead of instant closing. Works only on
          Windows 2000 and Windows XP.


      * Prevent show in fullscreen

          When you are working on fullscreen mode
          (Media Player, games, etc) the OSD window won´t open.


      * Prevent override topmost windows

          If you are in a "topmost" window the OSD won´t be shown over this window.
